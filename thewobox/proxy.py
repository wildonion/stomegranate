# TO SETUP YOUR VPN SERVER:
# build smt like mtproto but i'll encrypt whole network traffic not just the app traffic
# whole networking concepts in linux and windows(know all about Network and Sharing Center in windows)
# create ur firewall for ur system and ur icfu lab
# know these: shared host - cloud hosting - vPS - dedicated server cloud computing technology - cloud server - hybrid server - cluster server
# create a MTproto proxy like telegram
# use ipsec to build ur vpn server and 
# implement RSA or AES in your server from scratch
# build server like apache and nginx with raspi to use it in localhost and real server
# read code of openvpn and work with it in kali terminal
# multi-threaded proxy server capable of handling HTTP traffic
# create a proxy of any kind of it with ur own algorithm like openvpn algo to use it in your vpn server 
# cluster concepts to build a vpn server with raspi
# buy a vps with high upload bandwidth and setup vpn(like openvpn) on it to get a vpn server
# know all proxy algorithms: super kerio - PPTP - L2TP - Cisco - SSL Tunnel - Super Tunnel - Fteproxy - obfsproxy - PM9 - HTTP
# know how filtering works using AI

buil my own proxy like who am i movie for exploitation jabs
Socket is used to transport data between systems. It simply connects two systems together, an IP address is the address of the machine over an IP based network.
With socket connection you can design your own protocol for network connection between two systems.
With Socket connection you need to take care of all the lower-level details of a TCP/IP connection.
create smt like ssh using my own cryptography algorithm and socket
create smt like freegate vpn

python telbot (scrapping bot, C&C bot)
python django (a telbot to send the post from my site to my channel[WOrld proj on kali] and a site to upload all of ur cvs icluding softwares and hardwares ops of ur team which has a chatapp)
python iot (raspi, nodemcu, iot cloud storages & django)
python AD (kivy like chatapp[SCA folder] for all platforms with its cli[buildozer vm; use p2p(pyp2p) or client/server model] and use neo4jDB with tkinter & other uis libs)
python ANN (tensorflow in hacking with raspi[cv.py])
python ciphers, exploiting (decrypting & coding theory/encrypting crypto lib, socket programming & networking libs like scapy, exploiting modules like rop libs & its concept with ctypes lib)
python p2p apps(chatapp & file sharing with pyp2p lib)
python gaming (pygame & other libs)
python assembly (sehllcode injection using ctypes lib)
python HardwareHacking (raspi tools and arduino stuffs, HHV videos, HID)
python simulation (simpy in networking and other majors) => search its books
host python code on pythonanywhere cloud or build your own server with raspi
Dapp creation like D-tube and steemit cuase it's new using below links and AI concepts

# TODO
#  all about dpi and softether & arvancloud & cloud computing models like serverless architecture and clustering concept
#  create tcp proxy using python socket
#  get the client request , decrypt it using ur wolgo
#  send the client request to destination
#  get the response from the destination , encrypt it
#  and pipe the respnse backed from the destination into the 
#  response object that you want to send to the client app
#  client app will get the response and decrypt it to see 
#  the rendered filtered page!
