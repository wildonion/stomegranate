'''                                                 BEFORE FURTHER COMPLETE BELOW WOKS ON <<R47s folder>> RATs AND ITS CODES
                                        U HAVE TO PUT THE "SIGN FILE" FEATURE IN UR ~WORAT TO SIGN DIGITALY UR BACKDOORS LIKE COBALT STRIKE
 ~WORAT has a large live virus DB for attack and is going to support all of ur exploits viruses backdoors worms and malwares that u built earlier
make its backdoor persistence, delete sms contacts et(got API restrictions?), live keylogger on startup, upload file => add these options for ahmyth none binary release
*install orcus on victims machine to jab on other victims on that network or wan using the first infected machine which is the first victim and the second server for jabbing:
    build first backdoor with ur server in ur machine then second backdoor with first victim on its machine with different ip and port third backdoor on second victim machine and so on
    from first victim machine scan the network for vuln ports and devices then build a backdoor in first victim machine and send it through socket(depends on socks[ip:port] proto: ngrok)
    send backdoor from target machine to other victims on that network(LAN) through socket(open ports[http://codezen.fr/tag/shellcode-exploit-overflow/]) or netcat => upload a copy of ur backdoor on other systems on LAN from victim sys
    with above way they have to reverse engineering the ips and ports to find u and if u r lucky to work fast they can't find u! => stay behind the ngrok on all victims machine
    got a open port from another victim sys on LAN then all u have to do is to send the backdoor file through socket(victim ip-port) to the victims machine then run it => is it possible? 
    scan network and find vuln(open) ports then connect to that ports using socket or http(according to its protocol) to take the control of system with s.send(cmd) => spreadness algo
    be a mitm in victim machine using ARP spoofing attack to get into other vuln devices on LAN using msf/nmap[use NSE feature also](smb ports exploit without user involved) which is installed on victim sys

 https://www.windowscentral.com/how-permanently-disable-windows-defender-antivirus-windows-10 => turn off victim defender in orcus or quasarRAT(off it inside the RAT)
'''
# create something like remote desktop for ur ~WORAT in Android section to controll remotely the android phone and run ngrok on ur raspi server from scratch => https://www.svenbit.com/2014/09/run-ngrok-on-your-own-server/ 
# use ur ~WORAT for baseband ops as an advanced C&C botnet(ACB) with a FUD backdoors and a secure server tunneling to interact with the attacker server and the vic machine in an encryptic manner; also host the main server on ur raspi and save all vics infos in a DB to sell them as a big data to black side of the WOrld!!
# ~WORAT like eternalblue exploit and using AI for both LAN & WAN but similar to Orcus => it has a menu for LAN/WAN attack then it'll scan the network and find a whole using AI to spread it itself on LAN after spreadness then it'll run itself hiddenly and send the backward connection to the attacker machine; if u choose on WAN it'll create a backdoor and u have to give it to ur vic with a se skill then it'll run itself hiddenly once it detect that is on vic machine using AI with a bypassing algo; cobalt strike, Orcus and msf are inspirations for ur ~WORAT; ur ~WORAT has a FUD backdoors cause ur method has a powerful algorithm!
# build ur own crypter/packer/protector for ur ~WORAT(AES for its encryption algorithm) => build ur ~WORAT exactly like Orcus for WILAM even stronger than that from some view; u can also get ur inspiration from QuasarRAT
# for DroidJack u need to forward two ports on ur modem: use this RAT only with se skills in a place where the modem is not urs and u have access to its gateway panel!
# run ur ~WORAT(WILAM C&C botnet RAT) with ngrok even on android(install ngrok on android or use ssh servo.netp[alternativeto.net/software/serveo/]); if u want to use telegram bot then no need to use ngrok cause its server it's running on http protocol ports so it's forwarded by default on telegram server only thing u need is a C&C bot to interact with the server.py which is the backdoor and is on target machine; portforwarding is required in those cases that we don't have a server to load our code from there and send command from anywhere! but telegram has its own server thus no need to portforwarding
# think about blockchain based C&C botnet RAT, C&C botnet RAT spreading using HIDs, Dapp creation and cross-platform based(JVM bytecode to bypass AV like shellcode or create a lang for urself with .erf extension) WILAM C&C botnet RAT(like msf features even stronger that msf with the most strongest bypassing AV algorithm for its backdoors) with ur ~WOCAPP
# put all ur codes(viruses) and projects in ur ~WORAT as a feature like(other RATs don't have it) all UT codes and other places in gDrive then think about a AI based C&C botnet RAT
# upload all ur knowledges, projects, codes & et on ur raspi server to host them with ngrok(use ur ~WOCAPP); know this that u have to build a web app using django api for ur RAT(http api RAT beside its WILAM)
# create a botnet in python to crash the system and do some spying things; u can also use ANN in this project
# shellcode injection and reverse shell feature for ur C&C botnet + think about an algorithm to bypass AVs using AI
# after u finish your code just make an exe file with a lovely icon from it and give that exe file to your targets
# u can inject your exe file into another one or just send your raw exe
# u can complete this code by getting help of other R47s folder github codes
# MUST DO: make it kind of persistence to run it constantly or add to startup or registry to run it in the back; or create shellcode from your code to run it in memory like other shellcodes 
# make it persistence by registering a key for this code
# get inspiration from lazy tools in remote access and orcus abviously; build ur ~WORAT stronger then orcus => get inspiration from all telegram bot codes like NR_RAT_BETA(RAT_via_Telegram) and BrainDamage and advanced RATs like Orcus and QuasarRAT in R47s folder
# bypassing AV using binding process or shellcode generation/injection(JVM bytecode) => generate shellcode to inject them into memory to bypass AVs
# A Trojan horse or virus on a computer inside your network could use UPnP to open a hole in your router's firewall to let outsiders in
# botnet features at the same time: send a sms from all victim's number to a specific number or take a picture from all victims at the same time or ping from target site with a massive victims like Orcus
# build a live keylogger using python kivy for android to capture the victims key and send it to my RAT server using socket
# With socket connection you can design your own protocol for network connection between two systems.
# With Socket connection you need to take care of all the lower-level details of a TCP/IP connection.
# see Exploiting\Shell\SPsheLLcodeInJeCtIoN\README.txt exploiting section for creating ur own shellcode of reverse shell to create ur backdoor for clients in which AV has been bypassed

fsociety to bring the fuckin bloody world for this shity world using vocfu bag(raspberry pi to get start with your WOrld, all arduino stuffs and hak5 tools) and 
gDrive(python & raspberry pi in whole CSR and their related sections in blackbox.txt to build your cv in fsociety, hack all the things using ANN, hacking and 
csr field like hacking big companies, exploiting all fumz, mtn, mci servers & their sites and IT companies like badkoobeh with your vocfu bag by using assembly & 
its shellcode, virus, malware, spyware, trojan, ransomware creation process concept with rop right next to its reverse engineering procedure , hacking the whole world of RFIDs 
and baseband OSes by building your own related hacking tools, uploading your bloody jabs(cvs, courses) and your whole life(all your situations that you've got) in your vocfusite 
or your app(android/desktop/web) which is built with python and has a nice UI with your logo at the bottom of it to introduce the bloody world of wild onion, write your about-me book app
using python, telbot to send the latest posts from your vocfu site to your telegram channel, speak with other hackers, pentesters and companies, send my ideas cv to big companies like google, 
work in bank and IT companies finally bring the hell for them) to get start with the first section of blackbox.txt and think about what kind of bloody world with its toolscript(app&device) by isnpiration of your ideas 
and their articles and using whole csr concepts u want to build for your criminals then fuck them with other sections(just work on what u need to know; dig deeper but never drown) with python in everything tenet!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwGVk33NXA => http RAT: it has a web panel and interact with urls api instead of direct command like tcp socket within its backdoor code; we don't need port forwarding for http based RATs cause its using the http web protocol which has port 80 forwarded by defualt on all http servers like nginx apache or other http servers but remember tcp socket is more fast than http cause it's a raw way to communicate and it's using ip:port(socks) for communicating and u can build ur own protocol with it like http(see Networking/~WOCAPP/README.txt)

how telegram bot API works for its server & its lib python and telegram bot API for C&C botnet + spread ur viruses using ur botnets and HIDs 
add fodhelper.exe feature, your V0iRUnion project virus and ransomware in telegram botnet
build smt like Airdroid & Lazy mouse with a different algorithm + build my C&C bot like telegram bot from scratch with/without a UI + telegram bot for payment apps
create RAT like C&C botnets or trutle folder code to control a massive targets with my command and spread itself through open port for DDOS attack or RA purposes with a UI like telegram bot
send telegram C&C botnet to ur target with SE skills each time or write it in some way in which it spread itself through open ports for DDOS or build a mirai botnet from scratch with python
think about BOTNET Detection Approach by DNS Behavior and Clustering Analysis + botnet DDOS detection using ANN or building botnet using ANN
build a C&C botnet(RAT) for all platforms[cross-platform] (a server ui and a client backdoor) using all codes in R47s folder:
    server ui: telegram bot api && electron nodejs && python terminal && django REST api for DB back-end & front-end of ur admin panel | client backdoor: buildozer apk && pyinstaller exe
    combine nodejs electron for server ui && python for backdoor client ; just remember msf and armitage is a botnet ui server
    spread ur viruse MAN spsi project malwares ransomwares binary exploits backdoors shellcodes(like reverse shell) into whole network with a strong spreadness algorithm through open ports
    spread ur viruses using ur C&C botnets and HIDs[also spread botnets with this tools]
    they are two types of jab: C&C botnet RAT && virues creation like stuxnet(destroy & clean the os to cry for victim) => u can spread ur virus with ur botnet also!
    think about fucking CS group specially the MAN like so:
    use msf backdoor attacks on windows and android with lazy TheFatRat tool & ngrok(install msf on ur vps to control the attack constantly)
    send python jabing scripts ur fsocietybot ur virus to fuck the MAN(upload virus or ur botnet in group and control it with ur C&C server like V0iRUnion or telegram or spsi_S or trutle)
    test ur fsocietybot(give ur C&C telegram botnet which the server is MAN or target machine) and ur virus project(the fodhelper fun) on this group specially the MAN
host my codes like all my botnets for testing and penjabing codes on my vps or pythonanywhere or my raspi server[this last one is the one that save the victims info in DB in baseband ops]
buy vps host and domain for myself from here: hostinja.com parspack.com && conncet to my linux vps using ssh
know these for ur raspi server: shared host - cloud hosting - vPS - dedicated server cloud computing technology - cloud server - hybrid server - cluster server

TODO:
build a p2p botnet(every client is a server so we can control the C&C server from our vics machine which are our servers) from scratch without helping of C&C bot like telegram bot; it can be either fully automatic bot or C&C botnet like trutle code(spsi_S project) or msf or even Orcus but for mine
create a botnet to create a smart contract code and send it to the server to mine crypto-curencies and attack the blockchain
build a mirai botnet and encrypt target files and drivers using ur C&C bot + add fodhelper.exe vuln feature to this botnet code
hack insta using phone number and other hacking app like follower gather apps(get them from playstore for testing) => hack android and windows again for fun with a backdoor
android & windows jabing on M & Z(fsocietybot.py C&C code to jab on windows[ work on R47s folder to read and complete all C&C codes which is better than msf in there & your fsocietybot.py too(see its related purposes at fsociety section in PenJab\README.txt)] or bloody teensy & its HID folder payloads or msf meterpreter sp & lazy backdoor injection[Dr0p1t framework in lazy & some codes for socket programming tricks] concepts(u can build your own msf like python for android hacking course & its payloads from scratch for client server files[Shell folder to reverse or bind the shell]); also see its related purpose at fsociety section in PenJab\README.txt & Exploiting foler)
django social login page and REST api(REST Websockets API with Django Channels) based for instabot script smt like instasaz site and build a chatapp in ur django site with websockets channels
make ur api using requests module => see above sources + build a instabot api from scratch first for hacking purposes
make ur django instabot site REST api based -> add ur instabot script to ur django instabot site -> use ur django apis to connect to ur instabot and other servers
bot api for instagram and django => api writing for django site(REST api) and bot creation : http RAT using django(api based)
create instagram bot using python to gather username & password from scratch; a follower gather app or a like hitting and like increasing bot => see above links to get an inspiration!
host your python server code on ur vps or pythonanywhere => pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/
instabot and telegrambot or just pythonbot to use them as my botnet with tkinter GUI
always make ur viruses persistence and spread them out with a new way => PYTHON + BASH + POWERSEHLL viruses & ASSEMBLY to generate shellcode viruses like stuxnet exploit
PYTHON+BASH+POWERSHELL >> SOCKET PROGRAMMING >> MSF BACKDOOR-SHELLCODE-VIRUS INJECTION >> C&C BACKDOOR TELBOT & HIDs PAYLOAD + powershell & bash & bat to fuck windows and linux with HID
find soroush app server ip for DDOS attack and server cracking with botnet and sentry MBA
change the ip of botnet constantly with a specific algorithm and how to spread it out to infect the whole network + build a botnet for DDOS attack
use telegram bot or build ur ui with django for ur botnet
https://github.com/sweetsoftware/Ares + read all pdfs in this directory
build smt like PySOD-master in UT folder to cath the fucking windows in BSOD
jab on android using another way in python like python for android hacking course(backdoor to gain remote access[codes in python-for-hackers(github)])
create my hacking tools with python and my teensy HID(hid virus & python exploits[spread python virus with my hid & its sdcard])
create a virus like stuxnet in python => https://github.com/micrictor/stuxnet
create a virus in python(RAT like C&C telbot, use socket in your virus, make ur virus persistence)
python C&C telegram bot & python bot(IRC) => use R47s folder codes
mass with someone using ngrok & django & tel(python) bot to send the link of django site with that telbot such that they can't close the tab; put a vulnerable script or a file in my site

how to connect my C&C bot to a vpn here or use a scure tunnel like SSL and telegram bot api its tunnel which is interacting with its user in a secure manner
basically trutle folder is a botnet; a reverse shell botnet ! u can use reverse shell socket concept or other stagers like http(s)to create C&C botnet in which ur ui are terminal and ur server.py file
https://telepot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
https://github.com/mwsrc
https://github.com/malwares/
https://github.com/malwares/Botnet

https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo
https://github.com/m0n0ph1/malware-1
https://github.com/RamadhanAmizudin/malware
https://github.com/ifding/iot-malware
use scappy module; i don't know why cause i saw some where ;-)
u can build ur bot natively using https://core.telegram.org/bots/api and requests or urllib module
build this bot for both windows and android; spread it as a vpn. for android use buildozer(python for android hacking course) and for windows use pyinstaller to pack ur bot
u can build this bot using telegram api bot for android or build ur botnet using python for android hacking course from scratch  
use this bot for jabing on CS group specially MAN
spread ur viruses using ur C&C botnets and HIDs
use REST api to build ur botnet with django
enecode all captured things by this RAT with pycrypto module && create a strong login system in order to not to find this bot easily like telegram bot api cause it's secure 
RAT encoding >> a secure manner for its spreadness algorithm like create a hiding algorithm to be hide from victim in whole networks and bypass all detections algorithms and anti viruses
RAT is a C&C botnet => botnets are always run so we can spread our viruses active our malwares or ransomwares at anytime in anywhere with just a one command which is the C&C tool
spread ur botnet into whole network and control them with ur C&C at same the time
Common Binary Executables: exe , dll , msi
More secure socket connection using SSL for its C&C like ssh: create smt like ssh tunnel for my socket server to make the connection secure between me and target by producing a ssl certification; telnet and netcat is not secure but ssh is, build smt like an encrypted tunnel protocol like the one vpn have using socket => encrypt ur socket tunnel for ur RAT like ssh in which ur whole protocol(ip:port) is secure and encrypted  
this bot will find the password of server database
scan open ports and send or spread itself using ssl socket through that port with s.send() method
use advanced phishsing to spread ur botnet through email
for android botnet build this algorithm: it'll send a sms from all victim's number to a specific number at the same time or take a picture from all victims at the same time => create it for C&C telegram bot and ur own bot which is smt like AthMyth
AhMyth-Android-RAT write send delete sms for its none binary release
use ur botnet(RAT)/HIDs to spread viruses malwares binary exploits shellcodes using the C&C/teensy & hak5 URD in WILAM => R47s folder codes for ur big C&C botnet RAT with python nodejs
compare python telegram C&C botnet with your(nodejs & python) other RATs for WILAM => think about ur big jab on baseband ops for its botnet(see fUcKmE.txt)
exploit for whole android like delete contact sms call logs + build a C&C botnet(RAT) for UMZ to interact with its servers
decompile and signing(TheFatRat) android apk and binding it using java -jar like AhMyth-Android-RAT => inspiration from TheFatRat and kali android tools like java -jar for binding signing apk backdoor for ur RAT
CSR with python && AD with nodejs && assembly for binary world => combine nodejs in my CSR python code ui | RAT server/client ui with react native & ngrok to control victims using our phone
know these for ur raspi server: shared host - cloud hosting - vPS - dedicated server cloud computing technology - cloud server - hybrid server - cluster server
a ddos botnet to spread itself with a strong spreadness algorithm and then after it spread itself in whole netwrok and other computers then u can ping with all of them with ur C&C server to fuck and take the entire server down(use lazy ddos tools)
we don't have access to outside a vps just like that; to the real server => write a botnet for server ddos like ddosing umz servers
use all ur knowledge in CSR for creating ur botnet cause ur botnet is going to be a virus like stuxnet or a RAT for ddos attack with just one command using its C&C
spread ur client file for ur botnet in target machines then with ur C&C server get a ping from all of them to shut the server down => add ping functionality in which it'll use other threads(u have to check multi threading or smt like that before)
use lazagne in ur botnet => upload lazagne on target machine then execute it to gather the whole passwords in a text file or send it for you in your tel chat pv; also use ur other codes and upload them to gather what u want
if u want to build ur botnet just remember u have to work on its multi threading for zombie attack and ping jab cause telegram C&C botnet has its own multi threading for doing this => think about a ping jab algorithm and how to make a zombie army from ur botnet in whole network
i've installed virtual machine A on machine B then how can i control the B with A; i want to control real server using its virtual machine; how can i access to the outside world of a VM like its main server => i've got VM A and machine B then i want to control B with A; test remote desktop in VM => vps concept
TELEGRAM USE ITS OWN SOCKET PROTOCOL CALLED MTPROTO TO SEND AND RECV DATA FOR ITS BOT
