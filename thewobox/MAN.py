#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# create a game like momo for MAN to make them kill theirselves
# this code is not a backdoor ; it's a virus that do its duty in order to cL34n 3v3RytH!n9 without a single foottep
# turn this file into exe using pyinstaller then use upx packer to compress or expand executable file
# put everything u think it'll destroy the MAN from inside in this code like ransom, scrap bot and execute arbitary command using fodhelper
# RANSOMWARE SCRAP BOT V0IRUS FOR MAN TO MAKE THE MAN PAY FOR cL34n 3v3RytH!n9 734Rs!
# MAN project is a static v0irus in which there is no third-party server to connect back
# use this project only for take the MAN down!
# pack this project as a exe, dll or msi binary files to bypass AVs
# use KrY.py to bypass UAC with fodhelper and execute arbitary command as an admin in ur MAN.py
# get help and all of ur inspirations from Crypter-master to build ur ransomware crypter algorithm; also use upx to bypass AV and pack it for ur ransomware
# OPTIONAL: ur ransomware has a C&C server in order to send the decryption key to the attacker but ur the cL34n man! r n't u? ;-) 
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# login into the vce then scrap the whole site and save it somewhere(email it using getnada.com or send it through socket[so in this case we need our OnionServer]) finally run the ransomware on their machine
# all about DDOS in MAN project
# the code must find user pass of one of MAN person then it'll login into vce using the correct credentials and finally will change some info like deleting all visions and much more
# build an algorithm to find them and only destroy MAN and their life
# https://www.youtube.com/user/PrivateSplat/playlists => build my own HID with python as its key pusher lib like rubber ducky or teensy: see HIDprog.py
# scraping bot is a bot in which u search for what u want with ur code and get that thing as a result of the search like getting all posts of a website which have html div section article ...

#***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
# WARNING: use fodhelper.exe bug(KrY.py) to bypass UAC and for bypassing AVs just create ur virus(like download and execute shellcode or any shellcode from a dirty jab with memory ) in assembly then make shellcode from ur assembly code finally inject it using python ctypes lib through a complicated way like Multi Threading into MAN memory

TODO: virus creation for linux & mac is easy cause the only thing u should do is u have to write ur virus in python script then let ur vic run it with a se skill! or build shellcode of ur virus for mac and linux
TODO: think about a strong algorithm for ur ransomware in which u have to get the decryption key and destroy it but just turn ur script into an exe with pyinstaller then bypass it using upx or any other method
TODO: think about to create shellcode from ur ransomware; basically it's the easiest and the hardest way at the same time to run this project!
TODO: change this code into a bot(scrap) to to the job itself
TODO: this code test student number and their id by building these credintials randomly for hp3 and vce site
TODO: make an app of this project for android and desktop using kivy buildozer tkinter pyinstaller or js stuffs
TODO: after you done; upload your code on github and make a package from to install using pip
TODO: test to send shellcode using this code to the server
TODO: write python script to find the error and open a browser for that error automatically in stackoverflow
TODO: make a powerful se scenario for spreadness of this code cause it's a ransomware scrap bot! spread it using ur own HID that u've built earlier: it won't connect back to the server cause it's not a RAT and doesn't have any server
TODO: use ur own method to encrypt the files on MAN machine other than system uptime to hash the thigns!
TODO: build this ransomware as a module in order to use it later on for other devices and targets
TODO: use this rasnomware after ur graduation from UMZ also do other coding jab on UMZ like gaining the control of whole servers with my ~WORAT C&C botnet
TODO: create smt like Kronos malware to steal bank account => https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/03/researcher-who-stopped-wannacry-ransomware-detained-in-us
TODO: use HaCoder.py folder to create a FUD backdoor using AES concept => see HaCoder.py folder

# WARNING: u can use sentry MBA to log into arbitary sites like vce; just create a combo list from all students number and their id(see below in order to get the idea of making the wordlist) then let the app work on that credentials to test each try! also test it on a vps

# find their id with a SE skill and coding(a random pattern algorithm)

# write a script to get into the vce pannel with a random student number and id
# https://www.youtube.com/user/PrivateSplat/playlists => build my own HID with python as its key pusher lib like rubber ducky or teensy
# this code is a login scraper for MAN project to login them and cL34n 3v3RytH!n9 or sell the scraped result like their info and marks; it's not a RAT at all just a scraping bot to scrap the directory in MAN system! so we don't have a server at all.
# this code is a ransomware code and make them to pay but wo can't return back the data cause he cL34n 3v3RytH!n9 with his algorithm => build smt like wannacry, coinvault and thanatos but with more powerful algorithm; it'll encrypt et and change the extension of every infected file to .wo then after one day cL34n 3v3RytH!n9: no encryption key need for a cRi3d onion!
# this code will encrypt all data in MAN machine then after a few days clean all those data and everything on MAN machine
