# create a password grabber like laZagne or mimikatz for post-exploitation jabs even more powerfull than laZagne or mimikatz
# create smt like laZagne which is built in python; u can use AI to decrypt the passeword(just see the voZagne.py and read the password hashing using ANN articles)
# turn your py file into exe with pyinstaller like laZagne.exe also read lazagne_macos.rar in ReverseEngineering folder
# NOTE: u can create shellcode from this code to inject it into memory using socket-programming
# NOTE: turn this code into a post-exploitation script. turn it to exe encoded and bypass it; it's a virus which contain assembly shellcode!
# NOTE: decompile laZagne script
# NOTE: use this script in HIDprog with ur HID tool => see the HIDprog.py
# NOTE: use bash scripting for linux architecture
