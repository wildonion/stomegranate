# HOST UR CODE ON PYTHONANYWHERE : https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/wildonion/files/home/wildonion
# USE @vocfu_bot BOT IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT
# module : python-telegram-bot or telepot
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# create a scraping telegram bot to find the hacking news, latest technology, malware virus codes and articles from websites and whole internet like https://thehackernews.com/, https://www.csoonline.com/ and github sources
# it'll send me massive of fresh news on a specific time based on C&C server
# fsocietybot using telepot or python telegram bot module to jab on M & Z & UMZ
# build smt like smart link cleaner telegram bot but for jabing to send it to groups and delete MAN pms => look vocfu_bot in bot.py file on pythonanywhere
# create fake members in telegram channels using telegram bot in python create it with an advanced GUI button
# create a python script for my musician thoughts with telegram bot => it'll get my thoughts of my mood then according to that mood it'll send me the best matched music! she(the bot!) can also recognize my voice and talk to me then send the matched music using telegram voice feature
# create a bot for spying groups chat and send all chats to my chat id or my pv
# they'll send a msg to ur bot then u can see their chat-id; also test that is it possible to send a msg to another chat-id from my bot which is in my pv except my chat-id[send a msg with ur bot to multiple chat-id including urs]
# build telegram bot RAT for android using kivy on kali(watch?v=ngbclmD2kvY and R47s/fsocietybot.py[PARSA proj]) just before u build ur ~WORAT also make it multi-threading => python for android hacking course[use telegram bot only for android RAT like building apk using kivy & put tel bot API modules in it]
# python virus and botnet like using django and ngrok for its interface instead of using telegram C&C ui
# like PARSA proj to create a RAT & C&C botnet backdoor for both android and windows using python for hacking android course; also make a permition for wifi in your backdoor to control it in server
# PARSAproj project folders code in buildozer(kivy os) VM by using python for android hacking course to build a backdoor using botnet concept for both android and windows
# a spying app to control the whole people with my tools like c&c code telbot or smt like msf using socket programming in which we'll need a big server
# think deeply about PARSA application project using python for android hacking course smt like msf => build smt like Airdroid for penjabing and hacking eb
# complete tel bot code on pythonanywhere cloud + use database for this code and store all chat-id in it
# python api with django/flask on pythonanywhere for telegram bot webhooks and other apps 
# read the wp-how-cybercriminals-can-abuse-chat-platform-apis-as-cnc-infrastructures.pdf in R47s folder
# use telegram bot only for android RAT like building apk using kivy & put tel bot API modules in it the spread it
# WARNING: if u want to create an android app just use flutter u fucking big fan!

# TODO: upload this code on github; so  work hard on it to build smt powerful
# TODO: build a bot for mafia game without using AI => build it like mafia app but with more features(download and install mafia to know the app! and rebuild it with telegram bot)
# TODO: build a python telegram bot rootkit to hide the process => get inspiration from BrainDamage also check telepot issue then use pyinstaller, upx & IEXPRESS and use another module except telepot
# TODO: a bot to change my telegram username randomly every month
# TODO: this bot can send my msg which i send to my bot earlier or it'll choose a random msg from DB to other groups and person => for sending to other groups we need the group chat-id and for sending to other person we need to get the chat-id of that person, in this case that person must send /start to my bot first
# TODO: use ICFU bot(vocfu_bot) which has a onion crying pic profile => make this bot a botnet to control all vics at the same time like if the bot is for android like sending sms from all vics number to another vic number at the same time or if the bot is for windows when i type off it'll turn all vics sys off at the same time
# TODO: build this code for jabing on cs group specially its MAN => send ur telegram bot to cs group then sit and watch the hell ;-)
# TODO: u can build ur own scraping bot from scratch using python requests, bs4 and lxml libs to send u thehackernews posts in a ui or store in text file; remember to use a secure algorithm that u r the only person who get these results like telegram botMasterID
# TODO: if u wanto to upload ur python none telegram scraping bot on pythonanywhere u have to upload the server side and the client side must be in your computer which can be on a terminal or a ui app to recv the result using tcp socke (OnionServer)
# TODO: u can build ur scraping bot with flask or django http api server and host it on pythonanywhere cloud which is http based request not a tcp socket! u can run http on socket => http is on top of tcp/ip

'''
python telbot (scraping bot, C&C bot)
python django (a telbot to send the post from my site to my channel[WOrld proj on kali] and a site to upload all of ur cvs icluding softwares and hardwares ops of ur team which has a chatapp)
python iot (raspi, nodemcu, iot cloud storages & django)
python AD (kivy like chatapp[SCA folder] for all platforms with its cli[buildozer vm; use p2p(pyp2p) or client/server model] and use neo4jDB with tkinter & other uis libs)
python ANN (tensorflow in hacking with raspi[cv.py])
python ciphers, exploiting (decrypting & coding theory/encrypting crypto lib, socket programming & networking libs like scapy, exploiting modules like rop libs & its concept with ctypes lib)
python p2p apps(chatapp & file sharing with pyp2p lib)
python gaming (pygame & other libs)
python assembly (sehllcode injection using ctypes lib)
python HardwareHacking (raspi tools and arduino stuffs, HHV videos, HID)
python simulation (simpy in networking and other majors) => search its books
host python code on pythonanywhere cloud or build your own server with raspi
Dapp creation like D-tube and steemit cuase it's new using below links and AI concepts
